How I imagine the script to work on Python

https://www.plus.nl/producten/aardappelen-groente-fruit

Paste the link to the listing of categories or subcategories of products
Then generate an xlsx file with:

All the info in the image attahced (Organize the columns, starting with categories, brand, brand, product name, subtitle, price and image link)

Ideally with a good interface (+ Share the process on how to run the script, libraries to install... we are non developers)

Your code will be studied by a CTO to make sure it is optimal
