I run a professional basketball agency representing basketball players around the world. I want to set up a program or a server where after each of my players game's their statistics at the end of the game are automatically gathered and sent to our agency. For example setting up a discord server or a whatsapp group where every players game statistics is automatically uploaded after each game. I am not a tech savvy person so I am open to any and all ideas on the best way to do this or programs to use.
