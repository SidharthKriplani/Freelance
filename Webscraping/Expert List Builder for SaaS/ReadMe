We need an efficient and detail-oriented freelancer who can get data from LinkedIn, Crunchbase, and other sources for a SaaS CEO.

Please read the job post in its entirety.

Here are the minimum criteria for the search. You need to get 7 out 7 categories. The requirements are non-negotiable.
 Company Country: US or Israel only
 # of FTEs/employees: 150-400
 Year founded 2006 or newer
 Website must have a public pricing page (watch video below on public pricing page)
 Crunchbase Category: SaaS / Software (see attachment)
 CEO has been on at least one podcast (see video)
 Must not be in the list of previously searched leads (we will provide the list)

Once you have found companies and CEOs who have met all these criteria, you would need to obtain the following information:
• Company Name
• Company Country
• Year Founded
• Crunchbase Category
• Company LinkedIn URL
• Website Address
• # of Employees
• Pricing Page
• CEO Full Name
• Podcast Appearance
• CEO LinkedIn URL
• First Name
• Last Name
• Title

Public Pricing Page:
The company's website must have public pricing pages. It should list the tier of prices and not a book a sales call page. Watch this: https://www.loom.com/share/355eb366c1694b55b481eda0a825adb3?sid=799f2c50-e124-4721-97c1-1c27e7d723a8

Pro Tip: Aside from Google Search, use https://www.listennotes.com or https://www.owltail.com to search if they've appeared on a podcast.

You must have your own premium subscription to get the information e.g. LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Crunchbase.

We will do a 1 hour paid test project. If the task took longer than 1 hour and you were able to deliver at least 80% good leads, then we will pay for your time in full.


You will be asked to answer the following questions when submitting a proposal:
Give 3 examples of a valid pricing page. Post the links. Any company would do as long as it's a valid pricing page.
