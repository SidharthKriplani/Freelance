- Manage a dataset comprising 1300-1500 emails.

Tools in Use:
While I have explored the use of Japier Transfer, it falls short in handling threaded emails. Therefore, the selected professional should be proficient in utilizing alternative methods to ensure comprehensive data extraction.

I require the data to be organized systematically in Google Sheets, month by month. This will facilitate efficient analysis and reporting.

If you have the expertise in data extraction from Gmail to Google Sheets, kindly share your relevant experience and propose your approach to managing threaded emails. Additionally, include a timeline for completing the task and your preferred compensation.

Thank you for considering this opportunity.
