I need a python script to be written that can scrape results from google scholar into a csv format.

(like this: https://proxiesapi-com.medium.com/scraping-google-scholar-with-python-and-beautifulsoup-850cbdfedbcf)

It will need to:
1) Work on search results that deliver approximately 10,000 results on google scholar.
2) Output into csv
    a) The URL
    b) the title,
    c) authors,
    d) "Cited by" figure
