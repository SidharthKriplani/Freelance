Hi, Simple enough project I would like completed. I have a list of all the stocks in the stock market. I would just like column "B" in this sheet to be translated to the company name e,g "Google", "Amazon" and "Apple". The current dataset has lots of noise e.g "Apple" is "Apple Inc. Common Stock" and would like it to just have "Apple"
