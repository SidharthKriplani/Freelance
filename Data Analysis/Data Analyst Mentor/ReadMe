Data Analyst/Power Query Expert Needed to Tutor and Help Build GitHub Portfolio

Hello! I am late stage in my career and looking to pivot into an entry level data analyst.

I'm looking for someone to meet with virtually for 60 minutes two times per week.  The following is the scope of work:

1. Help me with my beginner level data analysis assignments.
2. Help me develop a sleek and professional-looking github website as is done here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocdwh0KYeUs&t=1857s
3. Using public datasets, advise me on designing  2-5 interesting projects to include in my portfolio.

I will be working on my projects alone but anticipate that I will need 10 hours of live tutoring.  I would love to have this assignment finished by January 1, 2024.

Thank you!
