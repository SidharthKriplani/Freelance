We use Preset (https://preset.io/) for our BI. We have already created the integrations for the data sets. I require an individual to:
1) clean up the existing charts and data
2) create new charts (details to be provided)
3) create the new connection necessary for further chart building.

Before contacting me, please look at https://preset.io/ and have an understanding of what the platform requires so that we don't waste time.
