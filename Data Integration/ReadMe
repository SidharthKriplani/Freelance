Data Extraction: Extracting data from multiple source systems, which can include databases, files, web services, APIs, and more.
Data Transformation: Cleaning, structuring, and transforming the extracted data to ensure consistency, quality, and compatibility between sources. This may involve data cleansing, data enrichment, and data normalization.
Data Loading: Loading the transformed data into a target system, such as a data warehouse, data lake, or analytical database.
Data Synchronization: Keeping data across different systems in sync to ensure that changes made in one system are reflected in others.
Data Consolidation: Combining data from various sources to create a single, comprehensive view of the data for reporting and analysis.
Data Migration: Moving data from one system to another, often during system upgrades or platform transitions.
Data Aggregation: Aggregating data at different granularities to support reporting and analysis requirements.
Data Quality Management: Ensuring data quality by identifying and resolving data inconsistencies, errors, and duplicates.
Real-time Data Integration: Establishing processes to enable real-time or near-real-time data updates and transfers between systems.
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Processes: Designing and implementing ETL pipelines to automate data integration tasks.
Data Governance: Implementing policies and procedures to maintain data integrity, security, and compliance throughout the integration process.
API Integration: Integrating data through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to connect different software systems and enable data exchange.
Change Data Capture (CDC): Capturing and propagating changes in source data to target systems efficiently.
Data Virtualization: Creating virtualized views of data without physically moving it, allowing access to data in real-time.
